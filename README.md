# CKD Analyser
The study employs multiple methods, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, XGBoost, Artificial Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, and Long Short-Term Memory networks. These models demonstrate high accuracy, with several achieving perfect scores, in detecting CKD stages, utilizing techniques like SMOTE for balancing data and handling missing data efficiently.

Additionally, a mobile application was developed to provide instant CKD predictions based on the models, offering a user-friendly interface for entering clinical details and receiving predictions with confidence scores and visual explanations. This application is particularly valuable in resource-limited settings, enhancing accessibility to crucial diagnostic support.

The project underscores the potential of AI-based solutions in healthcare, particularly for early detection and management of CKD, promising to revolutionize approaches to disease prediction and treatment.
